# Rocket_Cpp_Graphics
This C++ graphics program visually simulates rocket launch, lunar journey, and successful landing, using simple animations and graphics.

1. This C++ program uses graphics to simulate the Chandrayaan 3 moon mission.
2. It starts by drawing the moon and Earth on the screen.
3. A rocket, representing the mission, is drawn and animated to launch from Earth, follow a curved trajectory, and land on the moon.
4. As the rocket reaches the moon, a success message is displayed, marking the successful culmination of the mission.
